# invoices
This is a very very simple and very very old and outdated little script I wrote when I was first starting out in web apps.
Its still very useful to me to keep track of the invoice I pay and I generate reports to submit to the tax man from this app...

If I have time or if you have time we could probably turn this into something quite nice..
